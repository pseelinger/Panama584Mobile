        <h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: 12vw;">The undercurrents of Bocas</h1>
        <p class="article_credits" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Written by:</strong> Anne Marie Haggerty</p>

          Bocas del Toro is a region off the western Caribbean coast of Panama known for its incredible beauty. Tourists snap pictures of crystal blue water and picturesque palm trees, not realizing the fragility of the beauty around them. Visitors snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters and watch friendly sloths and playful monkeys swing through tall, tropical trees in the rainforest.

        <p>
          But the beauty of Bocas that captivates so many is pulled by undercurrents of change.

        <p>Tourists snap pictures of glimmering blue waves as they wash up to kiss the warm, sandy coast. Jaunty palm trees and fallen coconuts punctuate the golden shoreline while brightly-colored flora and fauna, reminding visitors of their exotic location. But the captivating beauty of Bocas del Toro is conflicted by a growing undercurrent.</p>
        <p>Bocas del Toro is a breezy, tropical region on the Caribbean coast of Panama, known most widely for its picturesque beaches and aesthetic topography. Visitors flock to Bocas to snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters, search for friendly sloths in the jungle and encounter monkeys swinging through verdant, tropical trees in the rainforest. Many do not realize the fragility of the beauty that surrounds them. </p>
        <p>A short taxi ride out of the main city of Bocas Town, the capital of Bocas del Toro, reveals a concerning phenomenon: large, gray stones encased in twisted wires barricade the seaside. The makeshift-cages are in place to block crashing waves which threaten to wash over meager roads that transport tourists to hotels and scenic beaches. The fight for the shoreline is indicative of the struggle among needs for environment preservation, economic pressures from tourism, the rights of the indigenous population and an increasing need for Panama to advance as a developing country. </p>
        <p>Panamanian President, Juan Carlos Varela, recently arrived in Bocas del Toro for a national summit, attended by a cluster of governmental and indigenous leaders, to discuss such growing concerns in Panama. Maintaining the integrity of indigenous lands while recognizing the need for modernization moving forward was addressed -- and contended. </p>
        <p>Bocas del Toro is a unique place because a lavish ecosystem, incoming tourists from around the globe, considerable population of native citizens and the increasing demand for modernization all fuse together. Various undercurrents in the region are increasing in force and threaten to create an irreconcilable chasm in Panama.</p>

        <p>Many of the tensions in Panama are visible just beneath the surface of the shimmering sea. The coral reef in Bocas del Toro was once characterized by teeming life and a brilliant spectrum of colors. Electric blue octopi would glide across the ocean floor in blissful harmony with their dazzling yellow neighbors, the surgeonfish, as they swam in buoyant schools above them. Vivid purple corals, crimson sea whips and emerald seagrass served as visual reminders of the vivacious life of the sea.</p>
        <p>Much of the vibrant spectrum has faded to muted variations of brown, save a few areas still struggling for life. As a result, many fish and sea creatures have relocated in an effort to survive and thus left the reef barren. Ironically, the reef is slowly dying in part because of overfishing by the local population. </p>
        <p>Local boatman Inocencio &ldquo;Chencho&rdquo; Castillo has spent much of his life on the water. He used to make a living off of fishing in the sea, but most of his income was made selling the coveted indigenous delicacy of sea turtle eggs. After Chencho learned the extent of impact his hunting had on the rapidly decreasing turtle population, he transitioned to fighting for the preservation of the sea turtles he once hunted and sold. He moved off of the mainland to an island so that he could sleep with and protect the turtles from changing environmental conditions and adverse human influences.</p>
        <p>Environmental degradation is slowly diminishing the characteristic beauty of Bocas&rsquo; natural land. This has decreased the appeal for tourists to visit the country, which is problematic for the service-based Panamanian economy, of which tourism is integral. Vice President Isabel Saint Malo and Minister of the Environment Mirei Endara de Heras held a conference in Bocas del Toro to urge local business owners to pursue sustainable tourism operations in an effort to preserve the industry and not exploit the environment.</p>
        <p>Operations like Tranquilo Bay, an eco-lodge on the southern coast of Bastimentos Island, have spent years cultivating a haven for travelers to vacation in an environmentally responsible way. Guests immerse themselves in a rich world of biodiverse plants and animals, enjoying the thrills of seeing recently discovered species of butterflies or kayaking through lush mangroves rather than exploiting the environment and disturbing native animals for fleeting amusement.</p>
        <p>Respecting the environment and working to protect biodiversity is paramount. The harrowing repercussions of negligence to that regard are blatantly observed in the case of the banana.</p>
        <p>Bananas are central to life, both dietary and occupational, in Bocas del Toro. To the dismay of locals, the fruit faces the threat of worldwide extinction due to a lethal fungus. Because there is no genetic biodiversity in the banana, it is not able to fight against the disease that is targeted specifically to the strain. The banana will be wiped out if another breed is not created. </p>
        <p>The potential extinction of the banana will impact consumers around the globe as well as the Panamanian economy and, more directly, the livelihood of the people of Bocas del Toro.</p>
        <p>Many workers and consumers of the banana are from the indigenous population. The indigenous people of Panama are woven deeply into the fabric of the nation. They were the first inhabitants of the land centuries ago and have since operated through a simple sustenance-based economic system. However, due to an increase in industry, many have been forced to trade their thatched roof homes and hollowed-out canoes for commercial life. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the indigenous population owns land, la comarca, that is reserved for their use and can not be developed. However, governmental officials are under pressure to modernize the country and thus feel compelled to exploit the resources to do so, as in the case of wanting to blast for iron in Chiriqui. Maintaining the integrity of indigenous land while recognizing the need for modernization moving forward was addressed at the President&rsquo;s meeting with indigenous leaders. The tension between environmental preservation, indigenous rights and the need for modernization is an issue on the world stage, but seen clearly in the growing Panamanian chasm.</p>
        <p>As waves of progress roll into Bocas del Toro, the undercurrents of economic growth, ecological conservation and indigenous ways of life merge to show the future, not only for this island paradise, but for the whole of Panama.</p>
